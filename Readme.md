# service.subtitles.rvm.addic7ed

This ia a subtitles plugin for [Kodi](www.kodi.tv) mediacenter to download
TV series subtitles from addic7ed.com site.

This is a completely independent project that I've created for my personal use.
It has no relations to other Kodi plugins for addic7ed.com site that may exist.
I use it regularly and try to maintain it in working state.

**Warning**: Movie subtitles are not supported! For movies please use other plugins,
e.g. opensubtitles.

## Important note!

Starting from v.3.0.0 addon ID has been changed to **service.subtitles.rvm.addic7ed**
to avoid name conflicts with similar addons that may exist. This means that
v.3.0.0 must be installed from a repository or a .zip file as a new addon and
previous versions of this addon must be uninstalled manually.
